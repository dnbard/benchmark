# Benchmark ■■■▢▢

* [Array/List/Set Comparison](https://github.com/dnbard/benchmark/blob/master/docs/array.md)  - performance comparison between native array and several custom collections
* [Class declaration(`class` vs `function`)](https://github.com/dnbard/benchmark/blob/master/docs/class-vs-function.md) - difference between `class` and `function` usage in JavaScript
* Dictionaries - coming soon
* [Sorted Arrays](https://github.com/dnbard/benchmark/blob/master/docs/sorted-array.md) - performance comparison of several libraries that provide SortedArray collection

## How to run tests by yourself

* Clone this repo (or fork it and clone)
* Don't forget to install all dependencies:
```sh
npm i
```
* Run individual test, ie:
```sh
node sortedArray.js
```

*Note: All tests were done on my Intel i5 4690 with 16MB RAM on NODE v8.8.x. You may(and will) receive different test results on different environment configuration. Please use my results with caution :)*
